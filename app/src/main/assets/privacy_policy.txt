ColorBlendr is not responsible for the content, practices, or privacy policies of external websites.

Libraries, Dependencies, and Native Binaries
--------------------------------------------

ColorBlendr may rely on open-source libraries and Android frameworks strictly to provide functionality (e.g., Material Components, AndroidX libraries).
These libraries operate locally on your device and do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
The app may also include compiled native binaries (such as .so files) to enable features like local ADB connections or system-level operations.
All binaries run only on the user’s device and do not communicate with external servers.
The use of libraries and binaries is limited to providing the required functionality of ColorBlendr, such as interacting with system APIs.
If in the future any library or binary includes data collection or external communication, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

ColorBlendr does **not** use analytics, ads, crash reporting, or any third-party SDKs that collect data.
It does not share any information with third parties.

Children's Privacy
